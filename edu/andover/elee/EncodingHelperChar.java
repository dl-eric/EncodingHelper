/**
 * The main model class for the EncodingHelper project in Software Design,
 * Fall 2015, Phillips Academy.
 * 
 * Each object of this class represents a single Unicode character.  The class's
 * methods generate various representations of the character.
 * 
 * Every method that takes an argument may throw an IllegalArgumentException if
 * given an illegal input.  This includes codepoints that are out of the legal
 * range for Unicode, byte arrays that are invalid encodings for a single
 * character, etc.
